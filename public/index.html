              The way we elect our MPs is a system called First Past The Post. Under First Past The
              Post, a single winner in each individual constituency gets to represent that
              constituency in Westminster. When Parliament is formed, this means lots of small
              victories in constituencies can mean big results for one party, and the overall makeup
              of parliament does not reflect the way the country as a whole voted. For more
              information about why this is bad, you can read my

              This webpage attempts to simulate how the results of the 2019 elections might have
              looked if we used different systems of proportional representation, whilst retaining a
              geographic link between an MP and an area. There are, of course, caveats. We can
              assume some people may vote differently if the system was different, there may be less
              tactical voting, for example. The boundaries I've crudely drawn are simply the same as
              existing constituencies added together, but in the real world, a lot more care and
              attention would go into the boundaries. I've also invented some new names, and I
              didn't put too much thought into it, so please don't complain too much if the name
              doesn't make sense.
