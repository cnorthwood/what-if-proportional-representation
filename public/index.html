              The way we elect our MPs is a system called First Past The Post. Under First Past The
              Post, a single winner in each individual constituency gets to represent that
              constituency in Westminster. When Parliament is formed, this means lots of small
              victories in constituencies can mean big results for one party, and the overall makeup
              of parliament does not reflect the way the country as a whole voted. For more
              information about why this is bad, you can read my

              There are, of course, many other ways of running elections and working out who is the
              winner. The two most common variations are one where you elect more than one person,
              and the votes are distributed to make the makeup of those elected match the
              proportions of the vote. The other variation is where you can rank the candidates, so
              a candidate must receive 50% of the votes to win. If no candidate has received 50% of
              the vote, then the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and all the votes
              that went to that candidate are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on the
              next order in the rank for each voter. This continues until one candidate receives a
              majority of the vote.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is history in the UK for these variations. Until 1950, some constituencies could
              send more than one MP to parliament, and we have run elections in the past where
              candidates could be ranked. The three main voting systems to think about are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Alternative Vote: where you elect a single MP, but rank your choices. We had a
                referendum on this in 2011, but only 32% of voters backed the change to this system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Single Transferrable Vote: this is a combination of ranking, and electing multiple
                members. It is one of the most used election systems in the world, and is used in
                Northern Ireland for EU, local and assembly elections, as well as in Scotland for
                local elections.
              </li>
              <li>
                D'Hondt method: this is where you can elect multiple members, but you only choose
                one. This is how England, Wales and Scotland elect MEPs.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is an experiment where we consider what might happen if we elected our MPs the
              same way we elected our MEPs. We have the data we need to simulate this, because the
              method of making a selection is the same, but instead of having 1 MP to represent an
              area, we can imagine having many. In this experiment, I've combined our existing
              constituency boundaries into new constituencies, which overall elect 600 MPs to
              Parliament (the number proposed under the most recent electoral reform), but each
              constituency elects on average 8 MPs. In theory, this should result in a more
              representative parliament, but one where coalition governments become common, as it
              makes it harder for a government to get a majority, unless they also get a majority of
              the votes, which rarely happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are, of course, caveats. We can assume some people may vote differently if the
              system was different, there may be less tactical voting, for example. The boundaries
              I've crudely drawn are simply the same as existing constituencies added together, but
              in the real world, a lot more care and attention would go into the boundaries. I've
              also invented some new names, and I didn't put too much thought into it, so please
              don't complain too much if the name doesn't make sense.
